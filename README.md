# Methane Catalyst Optimization

This repository hosts the data structures, computational workflows, and analytical pipelines developed during my postdoctoral research. The project focuses on modeling the synergistic catalyst architecture of subnanometric gold-iron clusters for selective methane-to-methanol conversion using hybrid Density Functional Theory (DFT) and structural optimization algorithms.

## 📑 Manuscript Content & Abstract

### Abstract
The adsorption and activation of $\mathrm{CH}_4$ and $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ molecules over bimetallic $Au_xFe_y$ clusters ($x + y = 6$) for $\mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{OH}$ formation were studied in the gas phase through the $\mathrm{H}_3\mathrm{C–H} \rightarrow \bullet\mathrm{CH}_3 + \bullet\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{HO–OH} \rightarrow 2\bullet\mathrm{OH}$ bond cleavage processes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the PBE0 functional with the LANL2DZ effective core potential for $Au$ atoms and the Def2TZVP all-electron basis set for $Fe$ and organic atoms. From planar $Au_6$ and $Au_5Fe$ ground state (GS) structures, distorted and compact three-dimensional GS’s forms appear for $Au_2Fe_4$, $Au_3Fe_3$, $Au_2F_4$, $Au_1Fe_5$ and $Fe_6$. 

Charge transfer occurs from $Fe$ to $Au$, thereby favoring the $Fe_y$ sites for nucleophilic $\mathrm{CH}_4/\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ attacks. Our results show that the whole $\mathrm{CH}_4 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{OH}$ reaction, in the presence of $Au_xFe_y$ clusters, is clearly spontaneous, since the change of the free energy reaction reaches $\Delta G_{\text{react}} = -2.841\text{ eV}$ in $Au_4Fe_2$. The primary catalytic effect of $Au_xFe_y$ lies in lowering the radical formation energy from $19.60\text{ eV}$ in the gas phase to only $0.227\text{ eV}$ for the 1:1 Au:Fe composition. Computed reaction barriers for the $Au_xFe_y–\mathrm{HO}\bullet + \bullet\mathrm{CH}_3$ coupling step range from $1.349$ to $-0.269\text{ eV}$, indicating a highly favorable pathway. Among all stoichiometries, the $Au_3Fe_3$ shows the most pronounced total catalytic enhancement, highlighting the $Au/Fe$ synergistic role in promoting methane oxidation.

### 1. Introduction
Anthropogenic global warming is an undeniable reality, and developing strategies to convert methane into value-added products like methanol is crucial. Subnanometric gold clusters display unexpected catalytic activity arising from quantum size effects and low-coordination surface atoms, while iron clusters provide rich electronic/magnetic profiles ideal for redox reactions. Bimetallic architectures merge these features via structural stabilization, charge redistribution, and spin polarization. This work deciphers the geometric, electronic, and spin-state rules of $Au_xFe_y$ series optimizing targeted $\mathrm{CH}_4$ conversion under mild conditions.

### 2. Methodology
* **Initial Sampling Engine (`population_fitness.py`):** Implements a customized stochastic algorithm creating un-optimized atomic geometries in a bounded $6\text{ Å}$ cubic box to bypass structural stagnation in computational workflows.
* **Theory Level:** Gas-phase optimization using the hybrid functional **PBE0** (25% Hartree–Fock exchange). Relativistic effective core potentials (**LANL2DZ**) for $Au$, and triple-$\zeta$ **Def2TZVP** all-electron basis sets for $Fe, C, O, H$.
* **Energy Evaluation:** ZPVE corrections calculated with harmonic frequencies. Transition states ($TS$) verified using synchronous transit-guided quasi-Newton (**STQN/QST2**) routines coupled with the Berny optimization engine.
* **Data Persistence Engine:** Relational databases (`.db` files) store geometric structures, ionization traces (`vip_ev`, `vea_ev`), and convergence parameters via automated SQL transaction scripts.

### 3. Results and Discussion

#### 3.1 Reaction Scheme and Catalytic Strategy
In the absence of a catalyst, methane homolytic cracking demands an unfeasible energy envelope of $5.98\text{ eV}$. The introduction of the cluster surface triggers a 6-step mechanism to drop these constraints: (1) Adsorption, (2) Homolytic radical cleavage, (3) Methyl desorption/$\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ yield, (4) Radical-coupling $TS$ acquisition, (5) Methanol creation, and (6) Catalytic release.

#### 3.2 Cluster Properties
Ground state forms transition systematically from planar $Au_6$ configurations to highly packed, low-symmetry $3\mathrm{D}$ arrangements for iron-rich regimes. NBO parameters prove a steady intramolecular charge transfer from $Fe \rightarrow Au$, transforming the iron nodes into electron-deficient environments ideal for coordination.

#### 3.3 Catalytic Process: \(\mathrm{CH}_4 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \xrightarrow{Au_xFe_y} \mathrm{CH}_3\mathrm{OH}\)
Reactants attach strongly to $Fe$ nodes, driving a significant stretching elongation of organic bonds coupled with red-shifts on vibration states.

#### 3.4 Radical Formation & 3.5 C-O Coupling
Transition states tracking the actual $\mathrm{C-O}$ bond assembly. This visualization handles the accumulated coordinate trajectory profiles, noting a dramatic drop in dissociation energy down to $0.18\text{ eV}$ for equiatomic allocations.

### 4. Conclusions
* Bimetallic allocations govern the structural, magnetic, and electronic transitions of the active surface.
* $Fe$-heavy distributions maximize intermediate capture but introduce structural distortions, while $Au$-heavy configurations restrict reactant initialization.
* **The Equiatomic Optimum:** $Au_3Fe_3$ provides the lowest effective barriers by merging coordinate flexibility, polarization fields, and clean catalytic desorption.
